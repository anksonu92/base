## Purpose

Creates the base resources used by all LENS deployments.

## Details
- Creates a KeyVault (KV) and associated RBAC role assignments or (less preferred) access policies
- Creates a Storage Account with a Gen2 Datalake and assigned RBAC roles

## Usage

This module may be used via a module call specifying the following input variables.

```
provider "azurerm" {
  storage_use_azuread = true
}

resource "azurerm_resource_group" "example" {
  name      = "lens-example"
  location  = "eastus2"
}

module "" {
  source   = "<source-path>"

  resource_group_name = azurerm_resource_group.example.name
  location            = azurerm_resource_group.example.location

  depends_on = [
    azurerm_resource_group.example
  ]
}
```

## Gotchas
- Recommend LENS be deployed as a landing zone workload into its own Subscription following the [Enterprise Scale Landing Zone Pattern](https://github.com/Azure/Enterprise-Scale)
- Must have "Owner" permission on the LENS Resource Group (or at the Subscription level) to be able to perform RBAC role assignments. Please note that this is NOT overly privileged if following Enterprise Scale Landing Zone pattern.
- If using AzureRM provider < 3.x, be sure to enable `storage_user_azuread` to leverage MSAL authentication.
